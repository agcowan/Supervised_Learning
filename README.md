# Supervised_Learning

This notebook contains an example of comparing logistic regression and random forest machine learning models. I took the supplied data source and split it to test and train data, then scaled the data.


From there I fit each model separately and trained them, then tested the models and each of them came back almost identical, but my prediction of random forest returned as the more accurate model, if only by a finite amount.
